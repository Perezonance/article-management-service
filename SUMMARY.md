## Summary
    Although the assignment, at face value, seems simple, I definitely overestimated how much work I could accomplish in a 4 hour window. I expected to do a lot more such as containerize the application, leverage AWS DynamoDB, unit test, and more as I hypothesized in the readme.md.
    That being said, I do think that this CRUD API server does a good job to highlight my understanding of REST APIs, Golang, and general software principles. I was successfully able to leverage most of Golang's star features like concurrency but I also think that if I were to develop this application using a framework or tool like the Swagger Codegen to build this server, I would have spent much less time writing boilerplate and debugging.
    As far as flaws with the service, I see plenty. This isn't a surprise by any means given the time crunch but I do think that there is a lot of refinement that could be done to cut down redundant code and some of these functions are quite complex in nature and would benefit from being broken down.
